"""Create an automated card dealer for a Texas Holdâ€™em application.
It should be able to handle Deck objects, consisting of Cards.
Cards can be added or removed from Decks, and Decks can be shuffled
and sorted. When dealing cards, each Player receives a Hand
consisting of 2 Cards. After all cards are dealt, the Dealer should
draw the table Hand of 5 Cards
